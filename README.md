# Gold-Price-Prediction
This project uses a Random Forest Classifier, a popular ensemble learning algorithm, to predict gold prices. The model is trained on historical gold price data and relevant features extracted from various sources. The trained model is then integrated into a Flask web application, allowing users to upload datasets and obtain gold price predictions.
